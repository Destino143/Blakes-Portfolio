       <!--About Me-->
      <section id=#about>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I started my carrer in hospitality management when I was young. It started with my love of interacting with different people from all over. Also the  smile that they had with the service and product that they recieved. The harder issues that arrose throughout the day allowed me to use emphathy, understanding, and high problem solving to resolve issues effectenly. While hospitality management is a passion, I find that the love of problem solving and creating a persons thoughts through software devlopment is something that I really love doing. </p>
        
        <p> As a student at <a href= "
